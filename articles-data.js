        title: `ASSESSMENT OF MARINE DEBRIS POLLUTION OF
THE COASTLINE OF THE EASTERN PART OF KILDIN
ISLAND (BARENTS SEA)`,
        authors: ["Maria Menshakova", "Ramziya Gainanova"],
        text: `This article examines the pressing issue of the negative impact of marine debris pollution on coastal
ecosystems in the Russian Arctic. As part of the ʺArctic. General Cleanupʺ project to clean up
Kildin Island, the coastline in the northeast of the island was monitored. The study collected
samples, assessed the composition, and estimated the quantity of anthropogenic debris washed
ashore. It was found that metal and polymer waste predominate in the marine debris. It was shown
that the main source of plastic waste is fishing. This category of marine debris consists primarily
of fragments of fishing gear; tourism currently plays a minor role in coastal pollution. During the
coastal cleanup, it was discovered that washed‐up fishing nets pose a threat not only to wildlife but
also to rare plants that grow through the nets and are damaged during waste collection. The results
of the study allowed us to assess the nature and extent of pollution on the northeast coast of Kildin
Island. Kildin with marine debris, and also to identify the risks of damage to the integrity of the
vegetation cover during the implementation of pollution elimination measures.`,

        title: `DEVELOPMENT OF AGRONOMIC TECHNIQUES
TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF
PHYTOEXTRACTION OF METAL IONS FROM
INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER USING ALPINE FORGET‐
ME‐NOT`,
        authors: ["Menshakova Maria"],
        text: `This study investigates the development and optimization of a phytoremediation‐based agricultural
technology for the treatment of industrial wastewater, using Myosotis alpestris (alpine forget‐me‐
not) as a hyperaccumulator species. The experimental substrate consisted of vermiculite
preconditioned (aged) in wastewater from a mining and processing plant—characterized by
elevated concentrations of heavy and trace metals. To evaluate nutrient modulation effects on metal
uptake and plant tolerance, four experimental variants were established, each receiving incremental
doses of nitrogen‐amino‐phosphate fertilizer (0, 50, 100, and 150 mg N/kg substrate). After a
standardized growth period under controlled conditions, plant biomass was harvested and
segmented into roots, stems, and leaves. Elemental analysis was performed using inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP‐OES) to quantify the accumulation of seven
target metals: molybdenum (Mo), manganese(Mn), magnesium (Mg), copper(Cu), strontium (Sr),
vanadium (V), and iron (Fe). The findings reveal significant variations in metal translocation and
bioconcentration factors across treatments, suggesting that controlled fertilizer application can
enhance both phytoremediation efficiency and plant viability in metalliferous substrates. This work
contributes to the design of scalable, low‐cost, ecologically sound systems for remediating metal‐
contaminated effluents in mining‐affected regions.

        title: `SEVERITY OF COVID INFECTION AND FEATURES OF
LIFESTYLE, WORK ACTIVITIES AND COMORBID
BACKGROUND IN PATIENTS IN ARCTIC CLIMATE
CONDITIONS`,
        authors: ["Maria Menshakova", "Anastasia Kapusta"],
        text: `When large outbreaks of infection occur, it is always necessary to identify risk groups. A formal
approach to identifying and isolating these groups can cause a number of economic and social
problems. The aim of our study was to determine the degree to which comorbid conditions, lifestyle,
and work activities of patients influence the severity of COVID‐19. A total of 136 respondents were
surveyed in the Murmansk Region who had recovered from COVID‐19 before vaccination. The
survey questions covered both the patientʹs health and lifestyle (sleep duration, physical activity,
smoking status, stress level), as well as work conditions (presence of confirmed hazardous
conditions). It was shown that, along with well‐known factors such as blood type, age, gender, and
chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.), lifestyle, specifically physical activity and
sleep duration, can also influence the severity of COVID‐19. The frequency of acute respiratory
viral infections (ARVI) in each individual patient is also an important factor. For the first time, it
has been shown that low sleep duration increases the severity of COVID‐19 infection. No effects of
smoking, hazardous working conditions, the use of immunotropic medications, or adherence to
anti‐epidemic measures were found. The study results can be used to identify risk groups and
develop measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection.`,
