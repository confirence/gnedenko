THE COASTLINE OF THE EASTERN PART OF KILDIN
ISLAND (BARENTS SEA)`,
        authors: ["Maria Menshakova", "Ramziya Gainanova"],
        text: `This article examines the pressing issue of the negative impact of marine debris pollution on coastal
ecosystems in the Russian Arctic. As part of the ʺArctic. General Cleanupʺ project to clean up
Kildin Island, the coastline in the northeast of the island was monitored. The study collected
samples, assessed the composition, and estimated the quantity of anthropogenic debris washed
ashore. It was found that metal and polymer waste predominate in the marine debris. It was shown
that the main source of plastic waste is fishing. This category of marine debris consists primarily
of fragments of fishing gear; tourism currently plays a minor role in coastal pollution. During the
coastal cleanup, it was discovered that washed‐up fishing nets pose a threat not only to wildlife but
also to rare plants that grow through the nets and are damaged during waste collection. The results
of the study allowed us to assess the nature and extent of pollution on the northeast coast of Kildin
Island. Kildin with marine debris, and also to identify the risks of damage to the integrity of the
vegetation cover during the implementation of pollution elimination measures.`,

TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF
PHYTOEXTRACTION OF METAL IONS FROM
INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER USING ALPINE FORGET‐
ME‐NOT`,
        authors: ["Menshakova Maria"],
        text: `This study investigates the development and optimization of a phytoremediation‐based agricultural
technology for the treatment of industrial wastewater, using Myosotis alpestris (alpine forget‐me‐
not) as a hyperaccumulator species. The experimental substrate consisted of vermiculite
preconditioned (aged) in wastewater from a mining and processing plant—characterized by
elevated concentrations of heavy and trace metals. To evaluate nutrient modulation effects on metal
uptake and plant tolerance, four experimental variants were established, each receiving incremental
doses of nitrogen‐amino‐phosphate fertilizer (0, 50, 100, and 150 mg N/kg substrate). After a
standardized growth period under controlled conditions, plant biomass was harvested and
segmented into roots, stems, and leaves. Elemental analysis was performed using inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP‐OES) to quantify the accumulation of seven
target metals: molybdenum (Mo), manganese(Mn), magnesium (Mg), copper(Cu), strontium (Sr),
vanadium (V), and iron (Fe). The findings reveal significant variations in metal translocation and
bioconcentration factors across treatments, suggesting that controlled fertilizer application can
enhance both phytoremediation efficiency and plant viability in metalliferous substrates. This work
contributes to the design of scalable, low‐cost, ecologically sound systems for remediating metal‐
contaminated effluents in mining‐affected regions.

BACKGROUND IN PATIENTS IN ARCTIC CLIMATE
CONDITIONS`,
        authors: ["Maria Menshakova", "Anastasia Kapusta"],
        text: `When large outbreaks of infection occur, it is always necessary to identify risk groups. A formal
approach to identifying and isolating these groups can cause a number of economic and social
problems. The aim of our study was to determine the degree to which comorbid conditions, lifestyle,
and work activities of patients influence the severity of COVID‐19. A total of 136 respondents were
surveyed in the Murmansk Region who had recovered from COVID‐19 before vaccination. The
survey questions covered both the patientʹs health and lifestyle (sleep duration, physical activity,
smoking status, stress level), as well as work conditions (presence of confirmed hazardous
conditions). It was shown that, along with well‐known factors such as blood type, age, gender, and
chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.), lifestyle, specifically physical activity and
sleep duration, can also influence the severity of COVID‐19. The frequency of acute respiratory
viral infections (ARVI) in each individual patient is also an important factor. For the first time, it
has been shown that low sleep duration increases the severity of COVID‐19 infection. No effects of
smoking, hazardous working conditions, the use of immunotropic medications, or adherence to
anti‐epidemic measures were found. The study results can be used to identify risk groups and
develop measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection.`,

        authors: ["Maria Menshakova", "Ramziya Gainanova"],
        text: `The article presents the results of a study of the structure and assessment of the state of Potentilla
coenopopulations Arctic Rouy on the coast of Kandalaksha Bay of the White Sea. Population
monitoring of this plant species, listed in the regional Red Book, is relevant due to its vulnerability,
poor study, range fragmentation, and growth in areas subject to intense recreational impact.
Morphometric and demographic parameters were studied for five cenopopulations, and their
absolute and effective abundance, density, self‐sustainability, and vitality were determined. It was
found that the cenopopulations are predominantly sparse; in areas with minimal anthropogenic
impact, abundance and density increase sharply. According to the  ʺdelta‐omegaʺ  classification,
they are considered young and maturing. Analysis of recovery index values allowed us to classify
CP3 as stable, CP1 and CP5 as relatively stable, CP4 as unstable, and CP2 as critical. Factors that
influence the vitality of individuals include the density of the vegetation cover and the immediate
threat of mechanical damage to the plants. Given the increasing tourist flow and the lack of special
conservation measures due to the location of cenopopulations outside the boundaries of existing
protected areas, it can be concluded that P. arctica in the area under consideration is at risk of
population decline and extinction.`,

accumulation occurs at a low rate, due to the drastic suppression of plant life processes by toxic
metals and the inability to accumulate due to the cessation of division and growth. At lower
concentrations, intense metal accumulation is observed, which is significantly enhanced by the
simultaneous presence of both metals in the nutrient solution.`,

to Sustainable Business Models`,
        authors: ["Babaeva Zoya"],
        text: `Green entrepreneurship has emerged as a vital force in advancing the transition toward a sustainable
and inclusive economy, with small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) playing a particularly
dynamic role due to their agility, innovation capacity, and close ties to local communities. This paper
explores the key drivers and barriers that shape the development and scaling of sustainable business
models among green SMEs. Drawing on recent empirical studies, policy reports, and theoretical
frameworks from sustainability transitions and entrepreneurial ecosystems, the analysis identifies
critical enablers—such as access to green finance, supportive regulatory environments, consumer
demand for eco‐friendly products, and mission‐driven founder motivation—as well as persistent
obstacles, including high upfront costs, limited technical expertise, fragmented policy support, and
difficulties in measuring environmental impact. The study highlights the paradox that while green
entrepreneurs are often intrinsically motivated by ecological and social values, they frequently struggle
to reconcile these values with financial viability in conventional market structures. The paper concludes
by proposing an integrated policy‐practice framework that combines targeted financial instruments,
capacity‐building programs, streamlined certification schemes, and collaborative networks to
strengthen the resilience and scalability of green SMEs. Ultimately, fostering green entrepreneurship
is not only an economic imperative but a cornerstone of a just and transformative green economy.`,

        text: `In the context of growing demand for food and changing climate conditions, increasing the
efficiency of crop production in the northern regions of the Russian Federation is of particular
relevance. These territories are characterized by a short growing season, low temperatures, difficult
soil conditions and limited availability of traditional agricultural crops. The article considers the
possibilities of increasing crop productivity using innovative means: adapted varieties of
agricultural crops, modern agricultural technologies, plant protection products, digital technologies
and low‐mechanization. Particular attention is paid to the economic feasibility of introducing
innovations and their impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector in the northern regions.
In addition, an analysis of the possibilities of applying such innovative solutions in the Chechen
Republic is presented, which, despite favorable climatic conditions compared to traditional northern
regions, faces a number of specific problems: a shortage of qualified personnel, limited access to
modern technologies and insufficient financial support from regional structures. Examples of
successful implementation of elements of innovative crop production in individual farms of the
Arkhangelsk Region, the Komi Republic and the Chechen Republic are given. Recommendations
are proposed for state support, development of a scientific and technical base and training of
qualified personnel for the sustainable development of crop production both in traditional northern

        authors: ["Giao Tran Xuan", "Chernova Svetlana"],
        text: `This article critically examines empirically validated economic models that successfully integrate
environmental stewardship, social equity, and long‐term economic resilience—moving beyond
theoretical frameworks to actionable, place‐based strategies. Through a systematic comparative
analysis of 12 high‐impact cases across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa—including Costa
Rica’s payment‐for‐ecosystem‐services (PES) system, Denmark’s circular industrial symbiosis
networks, Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness (GNH)‐driven fiscal policy, and Rwanda’s green
growth and climate‐resilience strategy—we identify core structural features of effective sustainable
development models. Key success factors include: (1) institutional anchoring (e.g., constitutional
mandates, independent sustainability councils); (2) economic instrument diversification (e.g.,
green taxes, sustainability‐linked bonds, results‐based financing); (3) multi‐level governance
alignment (local–national–global policy coherence); and (4) inclusive co‐creation involving
Indigenous knowledge, civil society, and private sector coalitions. The study debunks the myth of a
“one‐size‐fits‐all” model, demonstrating instead that contextual adaptability—particularly in
balancing state steering, market mechanisms, and community agency—is critical. We propose a
typology of four archetypal models: Ecological Fiscal Reform, Circular‐Regional Development,
Wellbeing‐Oriented Governance, and Climate‐Resilient Inclusive Growth—each with transferable
design principles. The findings provide policymakers and development practitioners with an
evidence‐based roadmap for designing context‐sensitive, scalable, and politically feasible pathways

AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES IN THE CONTEXT OF
DIGITALIZATION AND GREENING OF THE ECONOMY`,
        authors: ["Garun Sultanov", "Natalia Lazareva"],
        text: `The convergence of digital transformation and the global green transition is redefining the
foundations of agricultural competitiveness and resilience. This article examines how agricultural
enterprises can strengthen their economic security—understood as the capacity to sustain financial
stability, ensure resource sovereignty, and withstand systemic shocks—in an era marked by climate
volatility, technological disruption, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Drawing on empirical data
from the European Union, North America, and emerging economies, the study identifies three
strategic pillars for enhancing economic security: (1) digital integration (e.g., precision farming,
AI‐driven supply chain optimization, blockchain traceability), which improves productivity and
market responsiveness; (2) green transition alignment (e.g., agroecological practices, circular
bioeconomy models, carbon farming), which mitigates environmental risks and unlocks access to
green finance and subsidies; and (3) adaptive governance, including risk diversification, public–
private partnerships, and real‐time monitoring systems. The analysis reveals that enterprises
combining digital and green strategies achieve 20–35% higher operational resilience and 15–25%
better access to capital compared to those pursuing single‐dimensional approaches. However,
significant barriers remain—particularly for small‐  and medium‐sized farms—including high
upfront costs, digital literacy gaps, and fragmented policy support. The article proposes a holistic

initiatives, and AI‐driven genetic analytics, the promise of improved health outcomes is
counterbalanced by profound ethical, legal, and social challenges. This paper introduces the concept
of the human factor as a central pillar in the governance of genetic data, arguing that sustainable
health innovation must prioritize human dignity, equity, autonomy, and informed consent over
technological efficiency alone. Drawing on international frameworks—including the UNESCO
Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, the WHO guidelines on human
genome editing, and GDPR provisions on sensitive data—the study examines how current genomic
policies align with human rights standards. Through comparative analysis of national programs in
the UK (UK Biobank), Estonia (Estonian Genome Center), the USA (All of Us Research Program),

protection, public trust, and equitable access. Findings reveal that while genomic technologies
enhance early diagnosis and targeted interventions, they also risk exacerbating health inequalities,
enabling genetic discrimination, and undermining privacy—particularly in centralized or state‐led
models. The absence of inclusive governance mechanisms often sidelines vulnerable populations,
contradicting the principles of sustainability and social justice. To address these challenges, the
paper proposes a Human‐Centric Genomic Governance Framework (HCGG), integrating ethical
foresight, participatory oversight, algorithmic accountability, and cross‐sectoral alignment with the
